# Hand_Gestures_Drawing_Application
This project is a real-time hand gesture drawing application that allows users to draw on a digital canvas using hand movements detected via a webcam. The app leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing, while providing a clean and intuitive Tkinter-based GUI for color selection, brush adjustments, and canvas management.
