# Hand_Gestures_Drawing_Application
This project is a real-time hand gesture drawing application that allows users to draw on a digital canvas using hand movements detected via a webcam. The app leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing, while providing a clean and intuitive Tkinter-based GUI for color selection, brush adjustments, and canvas management.

## **🎯 Introduction**  
This application allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures detected via a webcam. It combines **computer vision (OpenCV + MediaPipe)** with a **Tkinter-based GUI** for an interactive drawing experience.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✔ **Hand Tracking** – Uses MediaPipe to detect finger positions.  
✔ **Pinch-to-Draw** – Close thumb and index finger to start drawing.  
✔ **Color Palette** – Choose from 5 different colors.  
✔ **Brush Customization** – Adjust brush size with a slider.  
✔ **Drawing Mode** – Toggle between drawing and navigation.  
✔ **Clear Function** – Reset the canvas instantly.  

## **⚙️ Installation**
